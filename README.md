# Researcher-Productivity-Tool

Nowadays, researchers in top universities are required to complete their research profiles. Such a move is necessary and important to increase the publicity of research output and potentially attract more public attention. However, across universities, webpages are arranged differently, creating difficulties for comparisons in research productivity across universities. This potentially affects public awareness of research quality. The goal of the project is to produce a tool that can collect publication information from Australian G8 universities, say, in the "Accounting/Finance" field and, based on a ranking list, to classify these publications, summarize all researchers' productivity, and make comparisons across universities. Minimum goal: Input - information from various webpages: 

1) corresponding webpages of individual researchers in Accounting/Finance in all G8 universities; 
2) ABDC journal ranking information: https://abdc.edu.au/abdc-journal-quality-list/ Output - a webpage to display individuals' numbers of publications in A*-, A-, B- and other categories, and it allows users to download the information as an Excel spreadsheet. On the webpage, for each individual researcher, there are hyperlinks to display a table of journal names, number of publications, year, keywords, etc. Medium-level goal: Output - dashboard for individual researchers' output based on various rankings. Apart from the ABDC list (in the minimum goal), use other journal rankings such as H-index, Journal Impact Factor, Clarivate. Beyond: Add more visualization tools that display the productivity of individual researchers; Provide summaries at the university level; Expand the field into other subjects such as Engineering, Computer Science, etc.
